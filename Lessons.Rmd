# Part I - EXPLORE  
The goal of this part is to understand *data exploration*  

1. Visualization  

2. Transformation - Key Verbs to select, filter, create, and summarize  

3. Answer questions using **transformation** and **visualization**  


## Chap. 1 - Data Visualization with ggplot2  

### First Steps  

**Question to Answer** - do cars with big engines use more fuel than cars with small engines?  

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

```

The *mapping* argument is always paired with aes(), and the args for aes specify the x and y values.

### Exercises  
1. Q: Run ggplot(data = mpg).  What do you see?  **Answer** - an empty plot

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg)
```

      
2. How many rows are in mtcars?  How many columns?  **Answer** 32 rows, 11 columns

```{r}
mtcars
```


3. What does the drv variable describe?  The type of drivetrain - front, rear, 4wd

```{r}
?mpg
```

4. Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = hwy, y = cyl))
```

5. What happens if you make a scatterplot of class vs drv?  Why is the plot not useful?  **Answer** Because this creates a scatterplot from 2 categorical variables.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = class, y = drv))
```

### Aesthetic Mappings  



This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
